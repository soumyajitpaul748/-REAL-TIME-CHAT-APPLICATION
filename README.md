Realtime Chat App
Real-Time Chat Application
Project Overview
This project involves building a fully functional real-time chat application using WebSockets for instant communication and a front-end framework such as Vue.js or React.js for a modern and responsive user interface. The application is designed to deliver a seamless chat experience by enabling users to send and receive messages in real-time, ensuring low-latency interaction.

Key Features
Real-Time Messaging: Messages are transmitted instantly between users via WebSockets, providing a smooth and interactive chat experience.

Responsive Design: The interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across different screen sizes.

Message History: Persistent storage of message history allows users to view previous conversations even after refreshing the page or logging back in.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive design that simplifies navigation and interaction for all users.

Scalability: Built with scalability in mind to support multiple concurrent users.

Technology Stack
Front-End
Framework: Vue.js or React.js

Styling: CSS/SCSS or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS for responsive design

Back-End
WebSocket Server: Node.js with libraries such as ws or Socket.IO

Data Persistence: A database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing message history

Server Framework: Express.js or Fastify for API endpoints (if required)

Additional Tools
Version Control: Git

Package Manager: npm or yarn

Deployment: Platforms like Vercel, Heroku, or AWS for hosting the application
